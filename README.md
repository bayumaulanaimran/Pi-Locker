**Introduction :**

Pi-Locker : "There is a punch of lockscreens for android Devices, but only little  have the simplicity + awesome features,
so we decided to save the world and create this lockscreen replacement.
This is not a coffee machine or your dishwasher,just an innovative lockscreen project that is still developing."

This customized Pi-Locker has pin keypad with randomized numbers placement. An experimental project that built only for study.

**About Project :**

Pi-Locker : "This is a result of combinining the best of each lockscreen in the platforms and adding our own touch to get the best lockscreen ever.

Pi Locker is the lowest ram consuming lockscreen ever.

Enjoy Our Experience."

Randomized pin keypad that built to this customized Pi-Locker is expected to minimize fingerprint smudges on the touch screen as a result of constant pressing of pin keys

**Pi locker :**

" The only lockscreen that is professional and opensourced, you cannot only [customize the lockscreen], but [fork the code and build your own lockscreen], because you deserve this and we support openness. "

This customized Pi-Locker is just for experimental study in software engineering to find out how effective the use of a randomized keypad is in reducing the constant smudges on the touch screen and reducing the risk of pin leakage.
